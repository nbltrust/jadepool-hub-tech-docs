### Separate Cold Storage
As hot wallet, Jadepool Hub must be equipped with another wallet which can be cold wallet, hardware wallet or mining machine depending on clients' business needs. Therefore certain percentage of the total assets will be transferred out of the hot wallet and safely stored in another trusted wallet.

### Secure Private Key Storage
Jadepool Hub's private keys are definitely not stored on server. For details please see [Private Key Security](security/seed.html)ã€‚

### High Performance
Modularization and micro-service enables Jadepool Hub to support distributed deployment, that means one server can be fully used for monitoring and processing requests for only one chain. This lowers the risk as much as improves the software efficiency.  

### Admin Management
Admin, a management web designed for Jadepool Hub, is provided to client for
monitoring Jadepool Hub running status. Based on different levels of role permission, clients are able to create hot wallet, view orders, check balance, audit, customize
configuration, manage roles and users etc.. It is a very convenient tool to manage the system within institution.

### Audit
For the safety of client's assets and data consistency, Jadepool Hub provides order tally and audit functions. Client is able to turn on and schedule the tally function on Admin, reports can be downloaded once tally is finished. Audit is the function that rechecks order's status with blockchain node.
