After the SeedVault program is initialized, a seed.json file is generated in the same working directory. This file contains the hash value generated by the initialization password. This hash value is used to verify password each time the program is being launched. In addition, seed.json file also contains a seed ciphertext, which is used to recover the seed plaintext together with the password. The seed plaintext is used to verify if the backup is successful. A hidden .seed.json.sha256 file will be generated as well. The program will fail to start if any contents in the json or sha256 file are 
jeopardized. The seed.json file looks like the json below:

```json
{  
   "hash":"IpIkgRObSSRMn6LoQ+Goq7FILViVlXJJZXMo4DiZbgbjt2L0QfAhcc2Eu3228P1Wb9XNqgA7wH5NY7JaREHjx+mqdhtPVtiCzNPrFQI1YfM=",
   "seed":"I8fM8r2++rN7r0cGZayrBpJ2CADAMCLkC83S+h2p7i3RvhhIuYM7VcH4Wf/fVdfy9WKxM1wGqx0VWxJARgcx3lp8NpzPX4f3vm0fYUOYwnE="
}
```

Backup steps are as below:
1. Complete the SeedVault program initialization first.
2. Paste command and enter the correct password:

```bash
./seed --path=./workpath/  --verify
```

3. Backup the seed plaintext and seed sha256.
4. Backup the seed.json and.seed.json.sha256 file under SeedVault program's directory.
5. Copy the backed-up seed.json and .seed.json.sha256 files to another computer under the SeedVault program directory (delete the seed.json file first if this SeedVault program has been initialized).
6. Paste command and give the correct password: 

```bash
./seed --path=./workpath/ --verify,
```

7. Compare the appeared seed plaintext and seed sha256 with the one you backed up earlier. If they are identical, the backup is successful.

```bash
	$ ./seed --verify
	data path: "./", port: "8899".
	Please input passowrd.
	->
	Password is correct.
