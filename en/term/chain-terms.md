### memo
It is a string provided to user and used by Jadepool Hub for recognizing deposits. For chains of "memo deposit mode", obtaining the deposit address is to get the hot wallet main address/account of Jadepool Hub and a deposit memo. Whether user transfers tokens from own account or from other exchanges, the deposit memo should be correctly filled in the transaction. Otherwise, the deposit will be mistakenly recognized as order of RECHARGE UNEXPECTED type. Memo is just plain string, it is unique in Jadepool Hub's database. Memo usually is 8 characters long and includes numbers and letters except for number 0, upper case letter O, upper case letter I and lower case letter l. All memo are case sensitive. 

### dust
Dust is the smallest utxo that can be included in a transaction. That means, any input's or output's value of a transaction must be higher than this value. Otherwise the transaction may fail to be broadcasted on blockchain. Dust is an unmodifiable configuration in Jadepool Hub.

### seed + derivative path
Seed is 64 characters long string. It is the origin of all Jadepool Hub's addresses. That is, Jadepool Hub can control addresses of all tokens and all hot wallets by accessing seed. However, addresses and private keys would be totally different if seed is replaced. Seed can derive a large number of private keys and addresses through derivative path. BIP44 proposes a 5-layer path to the HD wallet:
```
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
```

Jadepool Hub's seed can be generated and stored in two waysï¼š
1. Seed Vault: generated by a combination of password, timestamp and random number. It is stored locally on the server as encrypted. It cannot be decrypted without correct password.
2. HSM: randomly generated stored in security chip.
