Jadepool Hub supports main staking functions listed below. For more details please see [Delegation API](https://nbltrust.github.io/jadepool-api-docs/#delegation)

* Staking: similar to withdrawal process. Staking is done once Jadepool Hub sends out the staking transaction and it receives enough confirmations.

* Unstaking: similar to withdrawal process. Untaking is done once Jadepool Hub sends out the unstaking transaction and it receives enough confirmations. However, the fund will only be returned after the freezing period ends and it is a incoming transfer thus another order will be created.

* Claim Reward: Claiming reward is done once Jadepool Hub sends out the claiming transaction and it receives enough confirmations.
